**_Android: Real-time user location information for emergencies_**

Lodestar is an Android (API 23+) app intended to be used in emergencies to provide user location information to the emergency services. The app pulls location information from the device and uses geolocation and Google Maps integration to find the nearest known address to the user's latitude & longitude. A use case would be a hiker who is lost and requiring medical help.
